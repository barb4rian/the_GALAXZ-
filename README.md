# About
**Infinite Code** is a simple, beautiful repo to build habit and skill: solve one LeetCode (or algorithmic) problem every day for 30 days.  
The theme is *infinity* — tiny daily progress that sums to exponential growth.

This repo contains:
- A clean daily problem template (`DAY_TEMPLATE.md`)
- A progress tracker you can update each day
- Sample solutions (Javascript) and notes
- Aesthetic README and badges so it looks great in your GitHub profile

# Why this works
- **Micro-consistency:** 20–60 minutes every day beats random long sessions.
- **Patterns over problems:** we catalogue patterns (two-pointer, DP, graph) so you recognise them faster.
- **Public accountability:** commit each day — the repo shows your streak.
